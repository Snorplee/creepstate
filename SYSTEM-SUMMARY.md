## Technical Specifications

### Distraction Pattern Categories

| Pattern | Weight | Keywords | Timing Sensitivity |
|---------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Constitutional Crisis | 10.0 | executive powers, override Congress, suspend constitution | Critical |
| Emergency Declarations | 9.8 | national emergency, martial law, emergency powers | Critical |
| Military Actions | 9.5 | military strike, deploy troops, nuclear threat | High |
| Investigation Announcements | 9.0 | investigate Obama/Clinton, treason charges | Critical |
| Citizenship Threats | 8.5 | revoke citizenship, deport celebrities | High |
| Mass Deportation | 8.0 | deportation raids, ICE sweeps | Medium |
| International Conflicts | 7.5 | sanctions, trade war, diplomatic crisis | Medium |
| Controversial Appointments | 6.5 | loyalty appointment, purge officials | Low |
| Rally Announcements | 6.0 | emergency rally, surprise appearance | Medium |
| Social Media Storms | 5.5 | Twitter storm, all caps tweets | Low |

### Scoring Algorithm

The system uses a sophisticated multi-factor scoring algorithm:

```
Distraction Score = (Base Pattern Weight Ã— 0.3) + 
                   (Epstein News Factor Ã— 0.4) + 
                   (Pattern Intensity Ã— 0.2) + 
                   (Timing Sensitivity Bonus) + 
                   (Official Statement Weight) + 
                   (Major Epstein Development Bonus)
```

**Score Ranges:**
- 0.9-1.0: CRITICAL (Immediate investigation required)
- 0.8-0.89: HIGH (Strong distraction pattern)
- 0.7-0.79: MEDIUM (Notable correlation)
- 0.6-0.69: LOW (Potential pattern)
- 0.0-0.59: MINIMAL (No significant distraction)

### Correlation Analysis

The system performs sophisticated temporal correlation analysis:

**Correlation Factors:**
- Timing proximity (within 24-48 hours)
- News cycle intensity
- Pattern severity
- Official statement frequency
- Social media activity spikes

**Correlation Strength Calculation:**
```
Correlation = (High Severity Alerts Ã— Epstein Articles) / 10.0
```
