        Multiple sources indicate federal grand jury proceedings in SDNY expected to deliver additional sealed indictments related to Epstein network co-conspirators. Investigation targets high-profile associates not yet charged.
        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Evidence basis:&lt;/strong&gt; Maxwell trial testimony identified 8 "co-conspirators" who facilitated trafficking operations but were not charged. Federal prosecutors confirmed ongoing investigation into these individuals during 2024 congressional testimony.
        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Expected targets:&lt;/strong&gt; Business associates who provided properties, political figures who received donations, entertainment industry connections who facilitated access, and financial enablers who moved money through offshore accounts.
        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Legal precedent:&lt;/strong&gt; SDNY typically unseals indictments within 18-24 months of grand jury proceedings. Pattern suggests November 2025 timeline based on investigation start dates.
