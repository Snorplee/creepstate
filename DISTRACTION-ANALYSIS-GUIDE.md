- **Anonymous Research**: VPN/Tor support for secure investigation

**Distraction Patterns Monitored:**

| Pattern | Weight | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Constitutional Crisis | 10.0 | Actions suggesting constitutional violations |

- **Correlation Strength Meter**: Visual indicator of timing correlations
- **Timeline Event Correlation**: Red dots on events with distraction correlations
- **Interactive Alert Details**: Click alerts for full analysis
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick access to analysis functions

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Analysis System

#### 1. Execute the Python Script

```bash
# Basic execution
python3 auto-research.py

# With Tor for anonymity (requires Tor installation)
# Start Tor service first, then run:
python3 auto-research.py
```

**Output Files:**
- `research-report-YYYYMMDD.json`: Comprehensive daily analysis
- `distraction-analysis.json`: Web interface data file

#### 2. Web Interface Usage

**Access the Timeline:**
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. The distraction analysis panel appears automatically in the top-right corner
3. Click "ðŸš¨ Scan Distractions" to refresh analysis

**Interactive Features:**
- **Threat Level Indicator**: Shows current assessment (CRITICAL to MINIMAL)
- **Correlation Strength**: Bar showing timing correlation percentage
- **Active Alerts**: List of current distraction patterns detected
- **Timeline Correlations**: Red indicators on suspicious timing events

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- `Ctrl+Alt+D`: Refresh distraction analysis
- `Ctrl+Alt+T`: Quick threat level check
- `Alt+D`: Toggle alert panel visibility
- `Alt+R`: Refresh data

### Interpreting Results

#### Threat Levels

- **CRITICAL (9.0-10.0)**: Immediate investigative attention required
- **HIGH (8.0-8.9)**: Strong distraction pattern detected
- **MEDIUM (7.0-7.9)**: Notable correlation, monitor closely
- **LOW (6.0-6.9)**: Potential pattern, routine monitoring
- **MINIMAL (< 6.0)**: No significant distraction detected

#### Correlation Strength

- **90-100%**: Extremely suspicious timing
- **70-89%**: Strong correlation, investigate immediately
- **50-69%**: Notable pattern, monitor closely
- **30-49%**: Weak correlation, continue observation
- **0-29%**: No significant correlation

#### Alert Recommendations

The system provides specific action items based on pattern type:

**For Military/Constitutional Patterns:**
- Verify claims through official DOD/government channels
- Document all statements and executive orders
- Monitor international news sources for confirmation
- Track legal challenges to announced actions

**For Investigation Announcements:**
- Cross-reference timing with Epstein case calendar
- Monitor mainstream media for buried coverage
- Alert investigative journalists to patterns
- Preserve evidence of timing correlations

**For All Patterns:**
- Document social media activity
- Check for coordinated messaging campaigns
- Monitor civil liberties organization responses
- Verify timing against recent Epstein developments

## Advanced Features

### 1. Pattern Correlation Analysis

The system automatically cross-references:
- Trump announcement timestamps
- Epstein news publication times
- Investigation milestone dates
- Court filing schedules
- Media coverage patterns

### 2. Timeline Integration

**Visual Indicators:**
- Red pulsing dots on timeline events with distraction correlations
- Click indicators for detailed correlation analysis
- Hover tooltips showing correlation strength
- Color-coded threat levels

### 3. Data Export and Integration

**JSON Output Format:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-20T12:00:00Z",
  "threat_level": "HIGH",
  "alerts": [
    {
      "id": "alert_001",
      "pattern": "military_actions",
      "description": "Military actions or threats used to dominate news cycles",
      "score": 0.85,
      "level": "HIGH",
      "keywords": ["military strike", "deploy troops"],
      "recommendations": [...]
    }
  ],
  "correlation_analysis": {
    "correlation_strength": 0.75,

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Distraction analyzer not loaded"**
- Ensure `distraction-analysis.js` is in the same directory as `index.html`
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify file permissions

**"No data available"**
- Run `python3 auto-research.py` to generate initial data
- Check that `distraction-analysis.json` exists
- Verify file is valid JSON format

**Tor connection failed**
- Ensure Tor service is running
- Check firewall settings for port 9050
- Verify SOCKS5 proxy configuration

**Timeline correlation not working**
- Ensure timeline has loaded completely before analysis
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify event date formats in timeline XML

### Performance Optimization

**For Large Datasets:**
- Limit analysis to recent time periods
- Use filters to focus on specific event types
- Run analysis during off-peak hours

**For Real-Time Monitoring:**
- Set up automated scheduling with cron
- Use webhook notifications for critical alerts
- Implement database storage for historical analysis
